# Absenteeism_project
Python+SQL+Tableau (linear regression)
The business problem we want to solve and carefully look into the dataset is look at predicting absenteeism from work.


The problem is that the business environment of today is more competitive than it used to be.
This leads to increased pressure in the workplace.
Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that unachievable business goals and an elevated risk of unemployment can raise people's stress levels.
Often the continuous presence of such factors becomes detrimental to a person's health.
Sometimes this may result in minor illness, which of course is not desired.
However, it may happen that the employee develops a long term condition, an example being depression.
That being said, since we will be solving the problem from the point of view of the person in charge of productivity in the company, we won't focus on that facet of the problem.
Rather, we'll look at predicting absenteeism from work.
More precisely, we would like to know whether or not an employee can be expected to be missing for a specific number of hours in a given workday.



Then we will import and reorganize dataset in Python so that a statistical method called logistic  regression will lead to an output which will allow us to better predict future outcomes for new observations.
Finally, the fresh obtained information will be brought to Tableau for  a deeper understanding of  results, therefore improving the accuracy of your expectations regarding the new observations.
